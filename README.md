# CHAPTER-1-PORTFOLIO

In this chapter, I learned the basics of Flutter, an open-source UI framework developed by Google, which allows for cross-platform app development using a single codebase. I set up the development environment by installing the Flutter SDK and configuring an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with the necessary Flutter and Dart plugins. I explored the structure of a Flutter app, starting with the main.dart file, and understood the distinction between stateless and stateful widgets. I learned how to create layouts using Flutterâ€™s rich set of pre-designed widgets like Text, Container, Column, and Row, as well as handle user interactions with buttons and text fields. I also discovered the hot reload feature, which significantly improves productivity during development. Additionally, I practiced managing navigation between screens with the Navigator class and understood the importance of managing app state, especially using StatefulWidget and the setState() method. Overall, I gained a solid understanding of Flutter's framework and its core concepts, laying the foundation for developing more complex applications.
